Sentence Transformer
--------------------

Characteristics of Sentence Transformer (a.k.a bi-encoder) models:

1. Calculates a **fixed-size vector representation (embedding)** given **texts, images, audio, or video**.
2. Embedding calculation is often **efficient**, embedding similarity calculation is **very fast**.
3. Applicable for a **wide range of tasks**, such as semantic textual similarity, semantic search, clustering, classification, paraphrase mining, and more.
4. Often used as a **first step in a two-step retrieval process**, where a Cross-Encoder (a.k.a. reranker) model is used to re-rank the top-k results from the bi-encoder.

Once you have `installed <installation.html>`_ Sentence Transformers, you can easily use Sentence Transformer models:

.. tab:: Text

   .. code-block:: python

      from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer

      # 1. Load a pretrained Sentence Transformer model
      model = SentenceTransformer("sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2")

      # The sentences to encode
      sentences = [
          "The weather is lovely today.",
          "It's so sunny outside!",
          "He drove to the stadium.",
      ]

      # 2. Calculate embeddings by calling model.encode()
      embeddings = model.encode(sentences)
      print(embeddings.shape)
      # [3, 384]

      # 3. Calculate the embedding similarities
      similarities = model.similarity(embeddings, embeddings)
      print(similarities)
      # tensor([[1.0000, 0.6660, 0.1046],
      #         [0.6660, 1.0000, 0.1411],
      #         [0.1046, 0.1411, 1.0000]])

.. tab:: Multimodal

   .. tip::

      Multimodal models require additional dependencies. Install them with e.g. ``pip install -U "sentence-transformers[image]"`` for image support. See `Installation <installation.html>`_ for all options.

   .. code-block:: python

      from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer

      # 1. Load a model that supports both text and images
      model = SentenceTransformer("Qwen/Qwen3-VL-Embedding-2B")

      # 2. Encode images from URLs
      img_embeddings = model.encode([
          "https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/transformers/tasks/car.jpg",
          "https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/bee.jpg",
      ])

      # 3. Encode text queries (one matching + one hard negative per image)
      text_embeddings = model.encode([
          "A green car parked in front of a yellow building",
          "A red car driving on a highway",
          "A bee on a pink flower",
          "A wasp on a wooden table",
      ])

      # 4. Compute cross-modal similarities
      similarities = model.similarity(text_embeddings, img_embeddings)
      print(similarities)
      # tensor([[0.5115, 0.1078],
      #         [0.1999, 0.1108],
      #         [0.1255, 0.6749],
      #         [0.1283, 0.2704]])

With ``SentenceTransformer("sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2")`` we pick which `Sentence Transformer model <https://huggingface.co/models?library=sentence-transformers>`_ we load. In this example, we load `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2 <https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2>`_, which is a MiniLM model finetuned on a large dataset of over 1 billion training pairs. Using :meth:`SentenceTransformer.similarity() <sentence_transformers.sentence_transformer.model.SentenceTransformer.similarity>`, we compute the similarity between all pairs of sentences. As expected, the similarity between semantically related inputs is higher than between unrelated ones. Multimodal models like `Qwen/Qwen3-VL-Embedding-2B <https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3-VL-Embedding-2B>`_ can also encode images, audio, or video into the same embedding space.

Finetuning Sentence Transformer models is easy and requires only a few lines of code. For more information, see the `Training Overview <./sentence_transformer/training_overview.html>`__ section.

Cross Encoder
-------------

Characteristics of Cross Encoder (a.k.a reranker) models:

1. Calculates a **similarity score** given **pairs of inputs** (typically text, but also images or other modalities).
2. Generally provides **superior performance** compared to a Sentence Transformer (a.k.a. bi-encoder) model.
3. Often **slower** than a Sentence Transformer model, as it requires computation for each pair rather than each text.
4. Due to the previous 2 characteristics, Cross Encoders are often used to **re-rank the top-k results** from a Sentence Transformer model.

The usage for Cross Encoder (a.k.a. reranker) models is similar to Sentence Transformers:

Sparse Encoder
--------------

Characteristics of Sparse Encoder models:

1. Calculates **sparse vector representations** where most dimensions are zero.
2. Provides **efficiency benefits** for large-scale retrieval systems due to the sparse nature of embeddings.
3. Often **more interpretable** than dense embeddings, with non-zero dimensions corresponding to specific tokens.
4. **Complementary to dense embeddings**, enabling hybrid search systems that combine the strengths of both approaches.

The usage for Sparse Encoder models follows a similar pattern to Sentence Transformers:

.. sidebar:: Documentation

   1. :class:`SparseEncoder <sentence_transformers.sparse_encoder.model.SparseEncoder>`
   2. :meth:`SparseEncoder.encode <sentence_transformers.sparse_encoder.model.SparseEncoder.encode>`
   3. :meth:`SparseEncoder.similarity <sentence_transformers.sparse_encoder.model.SparseEncoder.similarity>`

   from sentence_transformers import SparseEncoder

   # 1. Load a pretrained SparseEncoder model
   model = SparseEncoder("naver/splade-cocondenser-ensembledistil")

   # The sentences to encode
   sentences = [
       "The weather is lovely today.",
       "It's so sunny outside!",
       "He drove to the stadium.",
   ]

   # 2. Calculate sparse embeddings by calling model.encode()
   embeddings = model.encode(sentences)
   print(embeddings.shape)
   # [3, 30522] - sparse representation with vocabulary size dimensions

   # 3. Calculate the embedding similarities (using dot product by default)
   similarities = model.similarity(embeddings, embeddings)
   print(similarities)
   # tensor([[   35.629,     9.154,     0.098],
   #         [    9.154,    27.478,     0.019],
   #         [    0.098,     0.019,    29.553]])

With ``SparseEncoder("naver/splade-cocondenser-ensembledistil")`` we load a pretrained SPLADE model that generates sparse embeddings. SPLADE (SParse Lexical AnD Expansion) models use MLM prediction mechanisms to create sparse representations that are particularly effective for information retrieval tasks.

Multi-Vector Encoder
--------------------

Characteristics of Multi-Vector Encoder (a.k.a ColBERT-style or "late-interaction") models:

1. Calculates a **sequence of token-level vectors** per input rather than a single fixed-size embedding.
2. Scores queries against documents with the **MaxSim** operator: for each query token, take the maximum similarity to any document token, then sum across query tokens.
3. Preserves **token-level matching information** that single-vector models discard, typically yielding stronger retrieval at the cost of a larger index footprint.
4. Recent VLM-backed variants (ColPali, ColQwen2, ColModernVBert, ...) extend this to **image documents** (each image patch becomes a "token"), enabling end-to-end OCR-free document retrieval.

The usage for Multi-Vector Encoder models follows a similar pattern to Sentence Transformers:

.. sidebar:: Documentation

   1. :class:`MultiVectorEncoder <sentence_transformers.multi_vector_encoder.model.MultiVectorEncoder>`
   2. :meth:`MultiVectorEncoder.encode_query <sentence_transformers.multi_vector_encoder.model.MultiVectorEncoder.encode_query>`
   3. :meth:`MultiVectorEncoder.encode_document <sentence_transformers.multi_vector_encoder.model.MultiVectorEncoder.encode_document>`
   4. :meth:`MultiVectorEncoder.similarity <sentence_transformers.multi_vector_encoder.model.MultiVectorEncoder.similarity>`

With ``MultiVectorEncoder("lightonai/LateOn")`` we pick a pretrained late-interaction model. Late-interaction models are particularly strong for **retrieval** tasks where token-level matching matters (named entities, exact-phrase queries, sub-document relevance). ColPali-style variants extend this to image document retrieval over scanned pages, slides, and figures.
